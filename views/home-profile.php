    <h3 class="subtitle">Why me ?</h3>
    <h2 class="title">A qualified and motivated future engineer</h2>
    <p class="pl-3 mb-0">
        Currently in 3rd year of my engineer diploma, I'm looking <strong>for a 3-months internship for the 2021 summer.</strong>
        I have always been passionate by computer sciences, and <strong>I develop for more than 6 years now.</strong> For about 3 years, I work every summer
        for web companies to help them during employees breaks. <strong>I mainly work on PHP back-end</strong>, which is what I prefer, but front-end is a part of my skills as well.
        <br/>Moreover, I recently started my own business where I realize e-commerce websites for professionals.
        I'm supplying to the Stripe Company because the <strong>Stripe web solutions have always been a model and a part of my work</strong>.
        In fact, <strong>I work with Stripe tools for about 2 years.</strong> I implemented Stripe billing, Stripe invoices, Stripe payments with payments intents or Stripe payment
        links.
        It has always been an evidence to use Stripe in my payment processes, and I always enjoyed using it.
        <br/>Also, the stripe's front website and the stripe's dashboard have inspired me a lot in terms of UI and UX for my personal and professional projects.
        That's why <strong>It would be for me an honor and a pleasure</strong> to work for Stripe and to contribute to making payments a lot easier across the world.
