    <h3 class="subtitle">Why me ?</h3>
    <h2 class="title">A qualified and motivated future engineer</h2>
    <p class="pl-3 mb-0">
        Currently in my engineer diploma's first year in France, I'm looking <strong>for a 3-months internship for the 2021 summer.</strong>
        I have always been passionate by computer sciences, indeed <strong>I have been developing for more than 6 years now.</strong> I have been working for
        web companies to help them during employees breaks every summer for the past 3 years. <strong>I mainly work on PHP back-end</strong>, which is what I prefer, but front-end is also a part of my skills.
        <br/>Moreover, I recently started my own business in which I realize e-commerce websites for professionals.<br/>
        I'm supplying to the Stripe Company because the <strong>Stripe web solutions have always amazed me during my work.</strong>
        In fact, <strong>I have been using Stripe tools for about 2 years.</strong> I implemented Stripe billings, Stripe invoices, Stripe payments with payments intents or Stripe payment
        links.
        It has always been an evidence to use Stripe in my payment processes, because of how simple and enjoying it is.
        <br/>Last but not least, the stripe's front website and the stripe's dashboard have inspired me a lot in terms of UI and UX for my personal and professional projects.
        That's why <strong>it would be for me an honor and a pleasure</strong> to work for Stripe and to contribute in making payments a lot easier across the world.
